## Overview

The research that Professor Kecia Ali and I worked on was a philosophical analysis of Nora Roberts' works to develop the idea of what constitutes a "good life." Nora Roberts, an accomplished American author, has a corpus of over hundreds of genre fiction books. Some of these books were written under her name, "Nora Roberts," and were typically romance novels, while others were authored under different aliases, ranging from futuristic murder mysteries to fantasy novels (Schreiber). Across these books, she developed her idea of the pillars that construct a "good life." Professor Ali defined these four pillars as place, work, partner, and community. However, given her extensive collection of books, substantial analysis was necessary to reliably and appropriately evaluate how her fictions articulated her vision of a "good life."

In this project, I implemented a linear regression model with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.329, which compared word frequency among different literary themes. I analyzed over 200 books by Nora Roberts, processing more than 1,000 unique word occurrences tied to feminist ideologies. Additionally, I extracted and synthesized Roberts’ philosophy of a "good life," advancing gender equality in the context of literary research.

## Research Significance and Impact

Nora Roberts is one of the most successful authors of her generation, critically acclaimed by various literary groups throughout her life. Her commercial success spoke for itself, as she consistently topped the charts as one of the bestselling authors in modern American literature (Schreiber). Unfortunately, her recognition often stopped there: as a major influence in the genre of romance literature. However, her work was much more than well-written romantic stories; it represented a library of deeper themes embedded within her narratives. Proper literary appreciation for her works are often undermined, as literary analysis frequently overlooked her thoughts as a philosopher.

The meanings and intricacies of such an impactful individual deserved to be taken seriously. By analyzing Roberts' literature from a more comprehensive and extensive point of view, we highlighted her contributions to empowerment, representation, and education. In doing so, we not only promoted further equality in the literary world but also established fiction literature as a valid source of philosophical analysis.

Additionally, the models and strategies we developed proved useful for other literary analyses. Future unrelated research could utilize the processes we performed to construct their own quantitative and qualitative studies for different popular fictions. Other scholars might be inspired to further study the works of other genre fiction authors using our digital tools. For example, another group of researchers could apply our methods to examine the psychological and sociological perspectives within Stephen King’s series of books.

## Methodology and Process

1. Data Collection and Cleansing: Collected the epigraphs and dedications from all of Nora Roberts' books, ensuring that the data was accurately transcribed and formatted for analysis.
2. Data Storage: Stored the collected data in a shared Excel file hosted on SharePoint to facilitate collaboration with Professor Kecia Ali.
3. Text Extraction and Word Frequency Analysis: Developed a Python script to process the text data, extract all individual words, and generate frequency tables for each word. This script also filtered out common stopwords to focus on meaningful terms relevant to the analysis.
4. Quantitative Analysis: Implemented a linear regression model to compare word frequencies across different thematic categories, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.329. This model was used to identify patterns linking literary themes to Roberts’ philosophical pillars of a "good life."
5. Thematic Categorization: Mapped frequently occurring terms to key themes such as empowerment, community, and partnership. This step required iterative refinement to ensure that thematic groupings aligned with the philosophical framework defined by Professor Ali.
6. Visualization: Created visualizations, including bar charts and word clouds, to represent the distribution of themes and highlight significant insights from the data.
7. Qualitative Synthesis: Synthesized insights from the textual and quantitative analysis to articulate how Roberts’ works reflect the pillars of place, work, partner, and community. This involved close readings of selected texts to contextualize statistical findings within narrative elements.
